# RPGless

RPGless is a tabletop role-playing game with no tables, no roles, and no playing.

## Setting

RPGless is a great fit for settings that lack a time period and a genre.

## Tools

No dice, paper, maps, miniatures, candles, bears, or Jenga towers are needed to play.

## Virtual tabletops

Any virtual tabletop can be used to run RPGless, provided you don't visit the site and don't log in.

## Getting started

To begin, don't gather around a table or join a call. Don't tell a story with your friends. Don't laugh together, become closer than ever, and explore your deepest fears. Don't participate in humanity's oldest social tradition.

Don't realize that simple pleasures like warmth, togetherness, kindness, and fun are the purpose of life.

## Rules

The rules of RPGless are incredibly simple. In fact, you've already memorized them.

**Character creation:** Characters don't exist.

**Combat:** Instead of fighting, don't.

**Task resolution:** Tasks are never attempted and can't succeed or fail.

RPGless is:

- Compatible with the fifth edition of the world's most popular role-playing game
- Pathfinder Compatible
- Compatible with the Cypher System
- Powered by the Apocalypse
